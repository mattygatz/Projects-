                                                 ###Project -1

## Implemented a Twitter Sentiment Analysis model that helps to overcome the challenges of identifying the sentiments of the tweets.
* Performed exploratory data analysis and Data Visualization of target variable.
    - Plotted distribution of data and countplot of Positive and Negative examples in the dataset using seaborn and matplotlib
* Performed various pre-processing steps on the dataset that mainly dealt with 
    - removing stopwords and emojis.  
    - converted the text document into lowercase for better generalization.
    - removed punctuation marks to eliminate noise from the dataset.
    - removed the repeating characters from the words along with removing the URLs as they are not important.
    - performed stemming and lemmatization for better results.
* Transformed dataset using TFIDF Vectorizer and trained different Machine Learning models to determine the best accuracy and improved the results.


                                                  ###Project-2 

## Developed a model for predicting fraudulent transactions for a financial company
* Performed data cleaning
     - removed outliers, non essential features
     - detected multicollinearity using VIF analysis
* Explored the best features to be used in the model using various feature extraction classes
* Deployed various models to predict the best accuracy and other performance metrics.
* Stated the key factors that led to the detection of fraudulent customers.
* Suggested various security measures to curb such attacks and various ways to check if the implementation is successful.
